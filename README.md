GravityPerturbationEGM96


The supplied scripts are used in determining the contribution of gravity perturbation on artificial satellites
in space.

test_gravity_perturbation:This script tests for the potential contribution of the geoid
 in terms of spherical harmonics up to degree and order 10 using EGM96 

test_gravity_perturbation_derivative: Calculates the harmonic terms for given degree and order that expresses 
the gravity perturbation derivatives. Gravity model that is used s EGM96
